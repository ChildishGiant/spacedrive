# Spacedrive Interface

Let's start by getting a clear understanding of the Spacedrive interface. Designed to mimic what you know and love with existing file explorers, but with powerful features and a universal desgin across operating systems.

## Sidebar

The sidebar starts with a library switcher, this allows you to change the entire context of Spacedrive quickly. Below it, you will see the contents of your library,such as Locations and Tags, Local drive explorer and active mounts, Network

## Explorer

The explorer is comprised of different views, List, Grid and Media View, with column and tree views on the way. The explorer can be used to navigate Locations, Tags, Local drives, Network drives, and even peer Spacedrive nodes.

In most cases Spacedrive is showing you the virtual representation of the filesystem, but is continuously refreshing the index to show you the latest changes. In the case of the Local explorer, it is showing you the actual filesystem without our "VDFS" layer. For large folders we stream the results from the underlying filesystem, which can sometimes be slower than the virtual filesystem.
